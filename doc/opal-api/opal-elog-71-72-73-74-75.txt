Error logging on FSP based machine:
-----------------------------

There are four OPAL calls for errorlog on FSP based machine:

#define OPAL_ELOG_READ         71
#define OPAL_ELOG_WRITE        72
#define OPAL_ELOG_ACK          73
#define OPAL_ELOG_RESEND       74
#define OPAL_ELOG_SIZE         75

Note: OPAL_ELOG_WRITE(72) Unused for now, can be used in future.

OPAL_ELOG_READ
--------------

This token is used to register a call which will copy the errorlog content to
the passed buffer with the passed elog id and elog size from the host kernel.

OPAL_ELOG_READ accepts 3 parameters:
- elog buffer
- elog size
- elog id

The call registered with this token returns OPAL_WRONG_STATE, when read
state of state machine is not in 'ELOG_STATE_FETCHED_DATA' or errorlog read
pending list is empty.

It returns OPAL_PARAMETER, when passed log id is not the same as log id of the
top node in the elog_read_pending list.

It returns OPAL_SUCCESS on successfully copying the errorlog data to the passed
buffer.


OPAL_ELOG_ACK
-------------

This token is used to register a call which acknowledges the passed ack_id
(elog_id) which in turn sends a acknowledgement to the FSP and move the
acknowledge elog id from processed list to the read free list.

OPAL_ELOG_ACK accepts 1 parameter::
- ack id

In case of opal errorlogs, for the passed ack_id the corresponding node is
returned to the pool of free object.

The call registered with this token returns OPAL_INTERNAL_ERROR on failure to
send acknowledement to the FSP and OPAL_SUCCESS on success.


OPAL_ELOG_RESEND
----------------

This token is used to register a call which will resend all the elogs again to
new kexec kernel.

The call registered with this token accepts no parameter and returns type is
void.


OPAL_ELOG_SIZE
--------------

This token is used to register a call which will fill information about the
errorlog like id, size and type.

OPAL_ELOG_SIZE accepts 3 parameters:
- elog ID
- elog size
- elog type

The call registered with this token returns OPAL_WRONG_STATE, when read
state of state machine is not in 'ELOG_STATE_FETCHED_DATA' or errorlog read
pending list is empty.

It returns OPAL_SUCCESS on successfully filling up the errorlog information
in passed parameters.
